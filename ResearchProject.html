        <h4>Four Interesting Facts</h4>
        <p>Viruses are malicious pieces of software that can infect and corrupt files, programs, and the computer itself. Some viruses encrypt files into an unusable format, rendering them useless. 

            Others worm their way into the inner workings of the computer’s hard drive, slowing it down, or preventing it from running altogether. 
                
            They can also target large networks, as they self replicate at an alarming rate and flood them with traffic (webroot.com). 
                
            Ransomware is one type of virus that cyphons money from users, it will encrypt files on one’s computer. The virus itself has an encryption key that can unscramble the files, for a price of course.
