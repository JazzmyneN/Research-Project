        <h4>What do people gain from this?</h4>
        <p>Many people use viruses to gain money, or damage an existing system. An example of a much more modern, and more damaging virus would be ‘WannaCry’. This specific virus demanded a ransom of 300 dollars in bitcoin in exchange for the users files back. The hackers, suspected to be from North Korea, gained an estimate of $50,000 dollars from this scheme (cnbc.com). People can gain money, or can slow down a company they dislike simply from infecting others with viruses.</p>
