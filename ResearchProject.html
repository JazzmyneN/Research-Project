        <h2>Viruses</h2>

        <h4>Brief Description</h4>
        <p>Viruses are software that replicate quickly and are made with the intent to cause damage or gain money. With viruses, the damage is usually done by ruining files are slowing down a computer or network. There are types of viruses that are more well known and dangerous than others. Two notable types are ransomware and spyware. Ransomware does exactly as the name says, demands money from the user in exchange for something. Spyware, on the other hand, is more subtle. It hides in the background and watches what you do, collecting personal emails or bank passwords.</p>

        <h4>Who started this?</h4>
        <p>The first well known virus was “Creeper”, it was made by Bob Thomas, and simply messed with printers and showed off self-replicating capabilities, not nearly as harmful as more modern viruses (technopedia.com). Originally, viruses were no more than harmless pranks fellow programmer would play on each other, or they were used to discourage the pirating of software; but now they have taken on a new more dangerous form with spyware, ransomware, and a host of other harmful viruses (us.norton.com). </p>

        <h4>What do people gain from this?</h4>
        <p>Many people use viruses to gain money, or damage an existing system. An example of a much more modern, and more damaging virus would be ‘WannaCry’. This specific virus demanded a ransom of 300 dollars in bitcoin in exchange for the users files back. The hackers, suspected to be from North Korea, gained an estimate of $50,000 dollars from this scheme (cnbc.com). People can gain money, or can slow down a company they dislike simply from infecting others with viruses.</p>

        <h4>Four Interesting Facts</h4>
        <p>Viruses are malicious pieces of software that can infect and corrupt files, programs, and the computer itself. Some viruses encrypt files into an unusable format, rendering them useless. 

            Others worm their way into the inner workings of the computer’s hard drive, slowing it down, or preventing it from running altogether. 
                
            They can also target large networks, as they self replicate at an alarming rate and flood them with traffic (webroot.com). 
                
            Ransomware is one type of virus that cyphons money from users, it will encrypt files on one’s computer. The virus itself has an encryption key that can unscramble the files, for a price of course.

        <h4>Examples of Viruses</h4>
        <p>Malware, Spyware, Worms, Boot Sector, Browser Hijacker, Resident Virus</p>

        <h4>How does this affect online culture?</h4>
        <p>This fear of viruses has also made way to hoax viruses, harmless ‘viruses’ that scare the user into thinking something is wrong. These are often used by scammers or fraudulent software, and are usually used to convince people to buy antivirus software.US Business are drained of about 55 billion dollars per year dealing with viruses alone, with another 8 billion being spent on preventing said viruses (webfx.com). </p>
