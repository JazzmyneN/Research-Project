        <h4>Brief Description</h4>
        <p>Viruses are software that replicate quickly and are made with the intent to cause damage or gain money. With viruses, the damage is usually done by ruining files are slowing down a computer or network. There are types of viruses that are more well known and dangerous than others. Two notable types are ransomware and spyware. Ransomware does exactly as the name says, demands money from the user in exchange for something. Spyware, on the other hand, is more subtle. It hides in the background and watches what you do, collecting personal emails or bank passwords.</p>

        <h4>Who started this?</h4>
        <p>The first well known virus was “Creeper”, it was made by Bob Thomas, and simply messed with printers and showed off self-replicating capabilities, not nearly as harmful as more modern viruses (technopedia.com). Originally, viruses were no more than harmless pranks fellow programmer would play on each other, or they were used to discourage the pirating of software; but now they have taken on a new more dangerous form with spyware, ransomware, and a host of other harmful viruses (us.norton.com). </p>
