        <h4>How does this affect online culture?</h4>
        <p>This fear of viruses has also made way to hoax viruses, harmless ‘viruses’ that scare the user into thinking something is wrong. These are often used by scammers or fraudulent software, and are usually used to convince people to buy antivirus software.US Business are drained of about 55 billion dollars per year dealing with viruses alone, with another 8 billion being spent on preventing said viruses (webfx.com). </p>
