        <h4>Who started this?</h4>
        <p>The first well known virus was “Creeper”, it was made by Bob Thomas, and simply messed with printers and showed off self-replicating capabilities, not nearly as harmful as more modern viruses (technopedia.com). Originally, viruses were no more than harmless pranks fellow programmer would play on each other, or they were used to discourage the pirating of software; but now they have taken on a new more dangerous form with spyware, ransomware, and a host of other harmful viruses (us.norton.com). </p>
